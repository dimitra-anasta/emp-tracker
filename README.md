## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Description

This assignment was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees and keeps track of the company's departments, employee roles, salaries, etc. The user can update the database through the terminal and answer questions in a  direct manner.

## Installation

To run the command line application, you have to run an integrated terminal and install npm. Next you type node server.js and the application begins. The user has a list of options to choose from. Using Javascript, I created functions for each question with inquirer prompt, and if statements to allow the user to select different choices. I created a database in my schema and created tables on that file. On the seeds file I inserted the values of the tables. I used db query to connect the information the user enters into the designated table.

## Usage

This is a great use for companies to keep track of employees and company informaiton. You can see the role of the team member, their manageer, and their department clearly and add more members in a simple, efficient way.
